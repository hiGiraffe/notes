# DATA STRUCTURES

### Packing and Encoding

**The idea of packing is to store more than one data value in a machine word. The related idea of encoding is to convert data values into a representation requiring fewer bits.**

#### Example

Encoding dates

- The string “September 11, 2018” can be stored in 18 bytes — more than two double (64-bit) words which must moved whenever a date is manipulated.

#### Idea

- Assuming that we only store years between 4096 B.C.E. and 4096 C.E., there are about 365.25 × 8192 ≈ 3 M dates, which can be encoded in ⎡lg(3×106)⎤ = 22 bits, easily fitting in a single (32-bit) word.

But determining the month of a date takes more work than with the string representation.

- Instead，pack the three fields into a word

  typedef struct{
  int year: 13;
  int month: 4;
  int day: 5;
  } date_t;

- This packed representation still only takes 22 bits(Actually this will pack the struct a little bit at the end), but the individual fields can be extracted much more quickly than if we had encoded the 3 M dates as sequential integers

**Sometimes unpacking and decoding are the optimization, depending on whether more work is involved moving the data or operating on it.**

### Augmentation

**The idea of data-structure augmentation is to add information to a data structure to make common operations do less work.**

- Appending singly linked lists

### Precomputation

**The idea of precomputation is to perform calculations in advance so as to avoid doing them at “missioncritical” times.**

#### Example

Binomial coefficients
【Latex 公式！！！！！！！！！】

- Computing the “choose” function by implementing this formula can be expensive (lots of multiplications)
- Watch out for **integer overflow** for even modest values of n and k.

#### Idea

Precompute the table of coefficients when initializing, and perform table look-up at runtime.

- Pascal’s Triangle
  - vertical axis - n
  - horizontal axis - k

### Compile-Time Initialization

**The idea of compile-time initialization is to store the values of constants during compilation, saving work at execution time.**

#### Idea

Create large static tables by metaprogramming.（easier in Python）

### Caching

**The idea of caching is to store results that have been accessed recently so that the program need not compute them again.**

- 可以做大一点的 cache，这样搜索 cache 耗时会增加，但也可以节省运行时间
- 可以在软件上实现而不依靠硬件的 cache 来做

### Sparsity

**The idea of exploiting sparsity is to avoid storing and computing on zeroes. “Thefastestwaytocomputeis nottocomputeatall.”**

#### Example

Matrix-vector multiplication

# LOGIC

### Constant Folding and Propagation

**The idea of constant folding and propagation is to evaluate constant expressions and substitute the result into further expressions, all during compilation.**

**With a sufficiently high optimization level, all the expressions are evaluated at compile-time.**

### Common-Subexpression Elimination

**The idea of common-subexpression elimination is to avoid computing the same expression multiple times by evaluating the expression once and storing the result for later use.**

### Algebraic Identities

**The idea of exploiting algebraic identities is to replace expensive algebraic expressions with algebraic equivalents that require less work.**

### Short-Circuiting

**When performing a series of tests, the idea of shortcircuiting is to stop evaluating as soon as you know the answer.**

&& ||

### Ordering Tests

**Consider code that executes a sequence of logical tests. The idea of ordering tests is to perform those that are more often “successful” — a particular alternative is selected by the test — before tests that are rarely successful. Similarly, inexpensive tests should precede expensive ones.**

### Creating a Fast Path

### Combining Tests

**The idea of combining tests is to replace a sequence of tests with one test or switch.**

Switch

# LOOPS

### Hoisting 循环不变代码外移

**The goal of hoisting — also called loop-invariant code motion — is to avoid recomputing loop-invariant code each time through the body of a loop.**

### Sentinels 简化循环边界条件

**Sentinels are special dummy values placed in a data structure to simplify the logic of boundary conditions, and in particular, the handling of loop-exit tests.**

### Loop Unrolling 循环展开

**Loop unrolling attempts to save work by combining several consecutive iterations of a loop into a single iteration, thereby reducing the total number of iterations of the loop and, consequently, the number of times that the instructions that control the loop must be executed.**

- Full loop unrolling: All iterations are unrolled.
- Partial loop unrolling: Several, but not all, of the iterations are unrolled.

### Loop Fusion 循环合并

**The idea of loop fusion — also called jamming — is to combine multiple loops over the same index range into a single loop body, thereby saving the overhead of loop control.**

### Eliminating Wasted Iterations 消除浪费的迭代

**The idea of eliminating wasted iterations is to modify loop bounds to avoid executing loop iterations over essentially empty loop bodies.**

# FUNCTIONS

### Inlining

**The idea of inlining is to avoid the overhead of a function call by replacing a call to the function with the body of the function itself.**

- 直接写入函数
- static inline 内联函数

### Tail-Recursion Elimination 尾调用优化

**The idea of tail-recursion elimination is to replace a recursive call that occurs as the last step of a function with a branch, saving function-call overhead.**

### Coarsening Recursion 粗化递归

**The idea of coarsening recursion is to increase the size of the base case and handle it with more efficient code that avoids function-call overhead.**

#### Chapgpt 对粗化递归的一个例子

粗化递归是一种优化技术，它通过减少递归调用的次数来提高运行速度。这通常是通过在每次递归调用之间执行更多的工作来实现的。

例如，考虑一个用于计算阶乘的简单递归函数：
def factorial(n):
if n == 1:
return 1
else:
return n \* factorial(n - 1)

这个函数每次递归调用都会执行一次乘法运算。我们可以对它进行粗化递归优化，使其在每次递归调用之间执行多次乘法运算，从而减少递归调用的次数：

    def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 1:
        result *= n
        n -= 1
    return result

这个优化后的函数只会执行一次递归调用，因此它的运行速度会快得多。

当然，粗化递归并不是每个情况下都能使用的，它只适用于一些特定的问题。但是，当适用时，它可以显著提高运行速度。

# Closing Advice

- Avoid premature optimization. First get correct working code. Then optimize, preserving correctness by regression testing.
- Reducing the work of a program does not necessarily decrease its running time, but it is a good heuristic.
- The compiler automates many low-level optimizations.
- To tell if the compiler is actually performing a particular optimization, look at the assembly code.
