**The usage of memalign():**

* fit within cache lines to reduce the number of cache misses.
* vectorization operators require a block of memory aligned to a multiple of 2.



We call failing to free **memory leak**.



**mmap():**

* lazy. It does not immediately allocate physical memory for the requested allocation but populates the page table with entries pointing to a special zero page and marks the page as read only.
* you can mmap() a terabyte of virtual memory on a machine with only a gigabyte of DRAM.

# The difference of mmap() and malloc();

* mmap() is to obtain memory (virtual address space) from the kernel.
* malloc() is to satisfy user requests for heap storage by reusing freed memory whenever possible.
