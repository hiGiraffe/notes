# Efficient Multi-GPU Graph Processing with Remote Work Stealing

A paper at the ICDE 2023 conference.

This paper analyzes the **dynamic loadimbalance** (DLB) problem and the **long tail** (LT) problem in multi-GPUs and solves them by adaptive remote work stealing onthe-ï¬‚y.



"A recent work [5] shows that systems lose nearly a third of device utilization, as they move from a single node to distributed implementations."
